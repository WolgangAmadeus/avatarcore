#summary Examples of practical applications of the Avatar Core framework.
#labels Phase-Implementation

The following examples show uses of the Avatar Core framework. They demonstrate features and provide solutions to common (or uncommon) problems.

All of these demos were built with [http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/ Flash Professional CS4], but their source code is external for inspection if you, yourself, are not using it.

== Simple Feature Selection ==
This demo covers the most common use case for Avatar Core.  You have an avatar character on the left and a set of options listed out on the left for changing the features of the character.  The interface consists of a group of standard Flash controls used to select the different features available to the avatar as defined in an external XML definition.

== Drag Features ==

This demo shows how Features can be moved (via Adjust) by dragging them with the mouse.  Making this work can be a little unintuitive, especially when it comes to parenting and behaviors like Mirror.  This approach takes into account those complications.
